# JavaScript Function Syntax 

- A javaScript is defined with the *function* keyword, followed by name, followed by parenthesses ().
- function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
- The paretheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1,parameter2...)

*arguments* are values received by the function when it is invoked.
inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

## Function Invocation 

- The code inside the functon will execute when something invokes calls the function:

    * When an event occurs(When a user clicks a button)
    * when it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
    * Automatically (self invoked)

## Function Return

when JavaScript returns a statement, the function will stop executing.

- if the function was invoked from a statement, javaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

## Functions Used as variable values

- functions can be used the same way as you
