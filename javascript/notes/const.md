## where to use JavaScript

***Use *const* when you declare**:

- A new Array
- A new Object 
- A new Function
- A new RegExp

* *const* does not define a constant value but a constant reference to a value

because of this you can not:

- Reassign a constant value
- Reassign a constant array
- Reassign a constant object

But you Can:

- change the elements of constant array
- change the properties of constant object
